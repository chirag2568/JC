            â€œI am Rishab, I live in the city of historical significance, Delhi. I am a student at the Krishna Public school, studying in standard six. In our family, we are two siblings. I have a younger sister. Our family consists of my sister, my father, my loving mother, and my grandparents.

            My father is a scientist whereas my mother is a schoolteacher. A lot of caring moments and love, is always what I get from everyone in my family. I am studying in one of the reputed schools in Delhi, which has always fed me to be motivated towards the future.
            
            All of my virtues have been incorporated in me by my school and helping is one of them. My school always aims at the holistic development of a student and it focuses on the fact that we develop both morally as well as academically. It is always a part of learning that you try to inculcate virtues in yourself by being an honest person. To be responsible and to adhere to your duties, is what our school teachers us.
